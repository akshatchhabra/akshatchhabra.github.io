## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ OpenReview (_February 2024 - February 2025_)**
- Designed and deployed a cloud-based sync service using Docker, Google Cloud Compute Engine, and Cloud Run. The pipeline processed over 7M publication records and 3.4M researcher profiles from platforms like DBLP on each run to update and enrich OpenReview data, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of reviewer-paper matching.
- Led plagiarism detection integration for OpenReview, enabling 1500+ conferences to verify submissions. Collaborated cross-functionally with stakeholders to align requirements and independently deliver the solution.
- Reduced the customer support teamâ€™s merge request workload by 90% by enhancing OpenReview APIs with automatic profile merging feature.

**Data Science Intern @ Microsoft (_January 2023 - February 2023_)**
- Reduced support workload by 70% by open-sourcing a proprietary testing tool for IVRs (Interactive Voice Response)
and chatbots built with Nuance Mix, a conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU) platform, enabling
broader use and contributions.
- Increased test coverage for the tool from 80% to 98% and implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and
streamline builds.

**Software Engineer @ JPMorgan Chase & Co (_August 2020 - January 2022_)**
- Reduced app size by 10% and enhanced consistency for Chase and JPM Android apps by spearheading platform
improvements and leading a UI uplift initiative to consolidate reusable UI components. Explored Jetpack Compose
adoption and contributed to migration planning from a Java/XML codebase to Kotlin-based UI architecture.
- Increased API reliability from 98% to 99% by identifying potential priority 1 incidents and enhancing monitoring with
new metrics, through the end-to-end development of a Python-based performance tracking tool.
- Awarded Transformer Award for outstanding delivery and performance.

**Software Engineer Intern @ JPMorgan Chase & Co (_January 2020 - June 2020_)**
- Boosted reliability for Chase and JPMorgan mobile apps from 99% to 99.5% by developing mobile applications (Android and iOS) for stress testing. Utilized Android and iOS SDK tools to capture video recordings of potential crashes, reducing issue resolution time by 50%.
- The script also recorded videos of crashes to speed up debugging process. The script helped improve stability percentage from 99% to 99.5%.
- Awarded Guards of the Fort Award for initiative and contribution.


## Projects
### TransLRPL 
[GitHub Link](https://www.github.com/akshatchhabra/TransLRPL)

Developed an LLM-based NLP system to enhance the translation of low-resource programming languages in collaboration with IBM Research. Implemented data augmentation techniques, including back-translation, to counter the lack of training data and improve translation accuracy.

### The Temple of Light 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshatchhabra/the_temple_of_light)

A puzzle game with the primary goal of imparting fundamental optics concepts to children, it involved solving puzzles that required the strategic arrangement of mirrors and lenses to precisely guide light in the intended direction. The game was written in C# and developed using the Unity Game Engine.

### Shakespeare It! 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshatchhabra/shakespeare-it)

Built an LLM-powered text style transfer system that transforms modern text into Shakespearean-style writing. Fine-tuned a T5-base transformer model on a non-parallel dataset using inverse paraphrasing to achieve stylistic transformation. ([Krishna et. al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05700))
