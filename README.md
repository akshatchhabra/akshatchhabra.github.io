**Software Engineer @ JPMorgan Chase & Co (_August 2020 - January 2022_)**
- Led platform initiatives like UI uplift which helped in improving the performance and consistency of the Chase and
JPM Android apps by making updates to close to 50,000 lines of code.
- Developed and deployed scripts to monitor API performance (helped spot 15 potential P1 incidents in the first month), and improved monitoring metrics.
- Developed scripts that retrieved feature flag data from a database and wrote it to CSV files, allowing the team to archive more than 40 flags that were not archived.
- Awarded the Transformer award for outstanding delivery and performance demonstrated during the projects.

**Software Engineer Intern @ JPMorgan Chase & Co (_January 2020 - June 2020_)**
- Developed a python script that integrated with Android SDK tools to stress test the Chase and JPM apps and find potential crashes.
- The script also recorded videos of crashes to speed up debugging process. The script helped improve stability percentage from 99% to 99.5%.
- Awarded the Guards of the Fort award for the initiative.


## Projects
### TransLRPL 
[GitHub Link](https://www.github.com/akshatchhabra/TransLRPL)

Implemented and evaluated data augmentation techniques for improving translation of low-resource programming languages in collaboration with IBM Research. Synthesized data using back-translation to counter the lack of training data.

### Shakespeare It! 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshatchhabra/shakespeare-it)

A text style transfer application that transforms a given text into the style of Shakespeare. The project used the T5-base transformer which was fine-tuned on a non-parallel dataset using inverse paraphrasing ([Krishna et. al, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05700))

### The Temple of Light 
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/akshatchhabra/the_temple_of_light)

A puzzle game with the primary goal of imparting fundamental optics concepts to children, it involved solving puzzles that required the strategic arrangement of mirrors and lenses to precisely guide light in the intended direction. The game was written in C# and developed using the Unity Game Engine.
